Why Use Atomic Operations?
Atomic operations are useful when:
    - Lock-free programming is desired, as atomics generally perform better than using mutexes for simple variable manipulations.
    - Non-blocking algorithms are required, as atomics do not involve blocking and waiting like mutexes,
     which can improve performance in some concurrent scenarios.
